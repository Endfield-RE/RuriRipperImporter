"""Put one of the game's UI display stages into the Blender scene.

Three things arrive, each straight out of the stage's own assets and none of them
invented here:

``HGEnvironmentPhase``   the sun -- direction, colour temperature, and the
                         PRE-DIVIDED intensity its own shaders are handed
                         (``directIntensityDividePi``; see ``_write_light``),
                         plus the sky's own ambient SH as the world colour.
``volume``               the engine globals the stage's own volumes blend to --
                         the post-processing switches and the character lighting,
                         packed the way the game's render pipeline packs them --
                         written onto the scene's world the way a level's are, so
                         the shading stacks read them live.
``stage prefab``         the stage itself, loaded through the kernel's one load:
                         floor, sky sphere, cameras, hierarchy 1:1.

    what READS this light is not Blender's own shading but the ported game
    shader (its ``mainLight.color`` capability is fulfilled with
